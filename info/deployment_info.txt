Deployment of `granite-3.1-8b-instruct` is a **GO**, but requires configuration.

### Reasoning:

1.  **VRAM Analysis**: The `granite-3.1-8b-instruct` model requires 18 GB of VRAM. The available NVIDIA GPU has 44.99 GB, which is more than sufficient to load and run the model.

2.  **Serving Arguments Analysis**: The model configuration is missing the required `serving_arguments`. This is a critical misconfiguration that would prevent the model from starting. Safe defaults must be generated.

3.  **Hardware Configuration**: With only one GPU available, the tensor parallel size (`--tensor-parallel-size`) must be set to `1`.

### Recommended Configuration:

Based on the analysis, the following serving arguments are recommended to ensure a stable and correct deployment on the single-GPU hardware.
```json
{
  "model_name": "granite-3.1-8b-instruct",
  "serving_arguments": {
    "args": [
      "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
      "--trust-remote-code",
      "--tensor-parallel-size=1",
      "--max-model-len=2048"
    ],
    "gpu_count": 1
  }
}
```

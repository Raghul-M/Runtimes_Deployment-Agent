Based on the analysis of the environment, the deployment status is as follows.

While the initial query mentioned a model requiring 36 GB of VRAM, the models found in the current configuration are `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` (18 GB), `granite-3.1-8b-instruct` (18 GB), and `whisper-large-v2-W4A16-G128` (VRAM unknown, but small).

All three models are a **GO** for deployment on the single GPU with 45 GB of VRAM, provided that the missing serving configurations are added.

### Deployment Decision: GO

Here is the detailed reasoning for each model.

---
### 1. Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

*   **VRAM Fit**: **GO**. The model requires 18 GB of VRAM, which fits comfortably within the available 45 GB on a single GPU.
*   **Serving Arguments**: **MISSING**. The model configuration lacks a `serving_arguments` section. A default configuration is required for deployment.
*   **Reasoning**: A `tensor-parallel-size` of 1 is appropriate for a single GPU. A default `max-model-len` of 2048 is a safe starting point.
*   **Recommendation**: Add the following serving arguments to the model's configuration.
```json
{
  "model_name": "Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
  "serving_arguments": {
    "args": [
      "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
      "--trust-remote-code",
      "--tensor-parallel-size=1",
      "--max-model-len=2048"
    ],
    "gpu_count": 1
  }
}
```

### 2. granite-3.1-8b-instruct

*   **VRAM Fit**: **GO**. The model requires 18 GB of VRAM, which is well within the 45 GB available on the GPU.
*   **Serving Arguments**: **MISSING**. This model also lacks a `serving_arguments` section and requires a default configuration.
*   **Reasoning**: As with the Llama model, a `tensor-parallel-size` of 1 is correct for the single available GPU.
*   **Recommendation**: Add the following serving arguments to the model's configuration.
```json
{
  "model_name": "granite-3.1-8b-instruct",
  "serving_arguments": {
    "args": [
      "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
      "--trust-remote-code",
      "--tensor-parallel-size=1",
      "--max-model-len=2048"
    ],
    "gpu_count": 1
  }
}
```

### 3. whisper-large-v2-W4A16-G128

*   **VRAM Fit**: **GO**. Although the exact VRAM requirement is not specified, this is a 4-bit quantized model with a small footprint (1.05 GB on disk). It will easily fit into the 45 GB of available VRAM.
*   **Serving Arguments**: **MISSING**. This model also requires a `serving_arguments` section.
*   **Quantization Compatibility**: **GO**. The `W4A16` in the model name indicates AWQ quantization. AWQ is broadly compatible with modern NVIDIA GPUs (Turing architecture and newer).
*   **Reasoning**: A default configuration is needed. It is crucial to specify `--quantization=awq` so the vLLM server uses the correct kernels to load the quantized model.
*   **Recommendation**: Add the following serving arguments, explicitly defining the quantization format.
```json
{
  "model_name": "whisper-large-v2-W4A16-G128",
  "serving_arguments": {
    "args": [
      "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
      "--trust-remote-code",
      "--tensor-parallel-size=1",
      "--max-model-len=2048",
      "--quantization=awq"
    ],
    "gpu_count": 1
  }
}
```

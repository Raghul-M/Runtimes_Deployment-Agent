### Deployability Decision Report

#### **Deployable Models**

*   **granite-3.1-8b-instruct**: Deployable
    *   **VRAM:** The model's VRAM requirement of 18 GB is well within the 192.0 GB capacity of a single GPU.
    *   **Hardware Compatibility:** The model is not quantized, so there are no quantization-specific incompatibilities with the available AMD accelerators.
    *   **Serving Arguments:** The model was missing a `serving_arguments` configuration. A safe default has been generated, setting `tensor-parallel-size` to 1 for single-GPU inference, which is appropriate for this model and hardware.

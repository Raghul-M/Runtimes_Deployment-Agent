### Deployment Decision: NO-GO

**Reasoning:**

The deployment cannot proceed. The primary and critical issue is the lack of available hardware. The `assess_deployment_fit` tool reports **0 available GPUs** on the cluster.

1.  **GPU Capacity vs. VRAM:** The `granite-3.1-8b-instruct` model requires 18 GB of VRAM. Your environment has no GPUs to meet this requirement, making deployment impossible.
2.  **Serving Arguments:** The model configuration is missing explicit serving arguments. While this is a secondary issue, running with default arguments can be risky. For a model of this size, it is best practice to explicitly define parameters like `tensor_parallel_size` and `max_model_len`.

### Recommendations for Future Deployment

Once a suitable GPU is available (e.g., a single GPU with at least 24 GB VRAM), I recommend using the following optimized serving arguments for stability and correctness.

**OPTIMIZED_SERVING_ARGUMENTS_JSON:**
```json
{
  "model_name": "granite-3.1-8b-instruct",
  "serving_arguments": {
    "args": [
      "--max-model-len=4096",
      "--trust-remote-code",
      "--tensor-parallel-size=1"
    ],
    "gpu_count": 1
  }
}
```

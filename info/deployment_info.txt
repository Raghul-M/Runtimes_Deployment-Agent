Here is the deployment deployability decision report.

Based on the hardware assessment, the `gpt-oss-120b` model is not deployable due to insufficient GPU resources, while the `granite-3.1-8b-instruct` model is deployable but requires a critical configuration update.

### **Deployment Analysis**

*   **`gpt-oss-120b`**: **Not Deployable**
    *   **VRAM vs. Capacity**: The model requires 264 GB of VRAM. The cluster has 3 GPUs, each with 45 GB, for a total of 135 GB. This is a significant shortfall, requiring approximately 6 GPUs to meet the model's needs.
    *   **Serving Arguments**: The model configuration is missing the required `serving_arguments`, which would need to include `--tensor-parallel-size=6` to span the necessary GPUs. Due to the hardware shortfall, this is a secondary issue.

*   **`granite-3.1-8b-instruct`**: **Deployable**
    *   **VRAM vs. Capacity**: The model requires 18 GB of VRAM and will fit comfortably on a single 45 GB GPU.
    *   **Serving Arguments**: The model configuration is missing the `serving_arguments` section entirely. This is a critical omission that would cause deployment to fail. I am recommending a set of safe, default arguments to ensure the model can be served correctly on a single GPU.

### **Optimized Serving Arguments**

The following arguments should be added to the model-car configuration for `granite-3.1-8b-instruct` to ensure a successful deployment.
```json
{
  "model_name": "granite-3.1-8b-instruct",
  "serving_arguments": {
    "args": [
      "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
      "--max-model-len=2048",
      "--trust-remote-code",
      "--tensor-parallel-size=1"
    ],
    "gpu_count": 1
  }
}
```

Based on the information from the cluster and model metadata, here is the deployment decision report.

### Overall Assessment

The cluster has a single GPU with 45 GB of VRAM available. This is insufficient for the total required VRAM of 190 GB, primarily due to the large `Llama-3-3-70B-Instruct` model. However, the smaller models in the configuration are deployable.

### Model-by-Model Breakdown

---

#### 1. Llama-3-3-70B-Instruct
*   **Decision**: `Not Deployable`
*   **Reasoning**:
    *   **VRAM Mismatch**: The model requires **154 GB** of VRAM, but the cluster only has a single GPU with **45 GB** available.
    *   **Hardware Mismatch**: To serve this model, a `tensor-parallel-size` of at least 4 would be required, but only 1 GPU is available. The deployment is not feasible with the current hardware.

#### 2. Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
*   **Decision**: `Deployable`
*   **Reasoning**:
    *   **VRAM Fit**: The model requires **18 GB** of VRAM, which fits comfortably on the **45 GB** GPU.
    *   **Missing Arguments**: The model configuration is missing the `serving_arguments` block. Safe defaults are required for deployment.
*   **Recommended Serving Arguments**:
    
```json
    {
      "model_name": "Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
      "serving_arguments": {
        "args": [
          "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
          "--trust-remote-code",
          "--tensor-parallel-size=1",
          "--max-model-len=2048"
        ],
        "gpu_count": 1
      }
    }
    ```

#### 3. granite-3.1-8b-instruct
*   **Decision**: `Deployable`
*   **Reasoning**:
    *   **VRAM Fit**: The model requires **18 GB** of VRAM, which fits comfortably on the **45 GB** GPU.
    *   **Missing Arguments**: The model configuration is missing the `serving_arguments` block. Safe defaults are required for deployment.
*   **Recommended Serving Arguments**:
    
```json
    {
      "model_name": "granite-3.1-8b-instruct",
      "serving_arguments": {
        "args": [
          "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
          "--trust-remote-code",
          "--tensor-parallel-size=1",
          "--max-model-len=2048"
        ],
        "gpu_count": 1
      }
    }
    ```

#### 4. whisper-large-v2-W4A16-G128
*   **Decision**: `Deployable`
*   **Reasoning**:
    *   **VRAM Fit**: While VRAM requirements could not be automatically inferred, the model is a 4-bit quantized model with a disk size of only 1.05 GB. Its VRAM footprint will be very small and will easily fit on the **45 GB** GPU.
    *   **Missing Arguments**: The model configuration is missing the `serving_arguments` block. Safe defaults are required for deployment.
*   **Recommended Serving Arguments**:
    
```json
    {
      "model_name": "whisper-large-v2-W4A16-G128",
      "serving_arguments": {
        "args": [
          "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
          "--trust-remote-code",
          "--tensor-parallel-size=1",
          "--max-model-len=2048"
        ],
        "gpu_count": 1
      }
    }
    ```

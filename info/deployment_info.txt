Deployment Decision: **GO**

### Reasoning:

1.  **VRAM Fit**: The model requires 18 GB of VRAM, and the single available GPU provides 44.99 GB. The available VRAM is sufficient for the model's needs.
2.  **Serving Arguments**: The model configuration is missing the required `serving_arguments`. A safe default configuration is recommended for single-GPU serving, including setting `tensor-parallel-size` to 1 and a default `max-model-len` of 2048.
3.  **Quantization**: No quantization method is specified for this model, so there are no hardware compatibility issues to consider.

The deployment is approved, but the serving configuration for the model must be updated as specified below.
```json
{
  "model_name": "granite-3.1-8b-instruct",
  "serving_arguments": {
    "args": [
      "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
      "--max-model-len=2048",
      "--trust-remote-code",
      "--tensor-parallel-size=1"
    ],
    "gpu_count": 1
  }
}
```

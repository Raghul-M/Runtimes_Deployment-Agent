### Configuration Summary
As reported by the Configuration Specialist, the model-car configuration specifies the following model:
- **Model:** granite-3.1-8b-instruct
- **Parameter Count:** 8 Billion
- **Estimated VRAM:** 18 GB

### Accelerator Summary
According to the Accelerator Specialist, the cluster environment is healthy and has available capacity:
- **Status:** GPU available
- **Provider:** AMD
- **Connectivity:** The cluster connection was successful, with no authentication or access failures.

### Deployment Decision
The Decision Specialist issued a **GO** verdict for deployment.

The decision was based on the following factors:
- **GPU Capacity vs Model Requirements:** The model's estimated VRAM requirement of 18 GB is well within the capacity of the available AMD accelerators.
- **Serving-argument Suitability:** The specialist identified that the model-car was missing a `serving_arguments` section. To ensure a stable deployment, it generated a safe default configuration.
- **Configuration Update:** Following the specialist's recommendation, the optimized serving arguments were written back to the model-car configuration by the Configuration Specialist. The applied arguments included setting the `tensor-parallel-size` to 1 for single-GPU inference:
  
```json
  "serving_arguments": {
    "args": [
      "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
      "--max-model-len=2048",
      "--trust-remote-code",
      "--tensor-parallel-size=1"
    ],
    "gpu_count": 1
  }
  ```

- **Environment Health:** The Accelerator Specialist confirmed that the cluster is reachable and accelerators could be inspected, indicating a healthy environment for deployment.

### QA Validation
As reported by the QA Specialist, the validation test suite **PASSED**. The tests were run against the `quay.io/rhoai/odh-vllm-rocm-rhel9@sha26:8fbdbf70f34250f36868c8a3b5dabe090218b081c38c1290d7f0e515078e16d2` runtime image provided by the Accelerator Specialist. The suite successfully deployed the `granite-3.1-8b-instruct` model and verified that it served inference requests correctly on the AMD GPU hardware.

### Configuration Summary
The Configuration Specialist reports the following requirements for the `granite-3.1-8b-instruct` model:
- **Image Size:** 15.24 GB
- **Parameter Count:** 8 billion
- **Estimated VRAM:** 18 GB
- **Supported Architectures:** amd64

### Accelerator Summary
The Accelerator Specialist reported a critical issue:
- **Status:** Cluster authentication failed.
- **Details:** The specialist could not inspect cluster resources and requested a login to the OpenShift cluster.

### Deployment Decision
The final deployment verdict is **NO-GO**.

- **Reasoning:** The Decision Specialist confirmed that while the model's 18 GB VRAM requirement would theoretically fit on an available GPU, the deployment cannot proceed. The primary blocking issue is the cluster authentication failure reported by the Accelerator Specialist. A secure and reachable cluster is a prerequisite for any deployment.
- **Serving Arguments:** The Decision Specialist also noted that the serving argument `--distributed-executor-backend=mp` is misconfigured for a single-GPU environment. Although optimized arguments were suggested, they were not applied to the model-car configuration because the environment is unhealthy and unreachable.

### QA Validation
QA validation was not run. The cluster is inaccessible due to the authentication failure reported by the Accelerator Specialist, making it impossible to conduct any tests.

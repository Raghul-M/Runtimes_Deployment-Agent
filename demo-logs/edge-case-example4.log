### Configuration Summary
The Configuration Specialist provided the following summary of the preloaded models:
- **Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct**: Requires an estimated 18 GB of VRAM.
- **granite-3.1-8b-base-quantized.w4a16**: Requires an estimated 5 GB of VRAM.
- **phi-4-quantized.w8a8**: Has an image size of 14.64 GB; VRAM was not specified.
- **whisper-large-v2-W4A16-G128**: Has an image size of 1.05 GB; VRAM was not specified.

### Accelerator Summary
The Accelerator Specialist reported the following about the cluster environment:
- **GPU Availability**: Not available.
- **GPU Provider**: None.
- **Recommendation**: No compatible accelerators were found in the cluster.

### Deployment Decision
The final deployment verdict is **NO-GO**.

This decision is based on the Accelerator Specialist's report, which is the definitive source for hardware availability. It confirmed that **no GPU accelerators are available** in the cluster. All models in the configuration require GPUs to run, and therefore deployment cannot proceed.

The Decision Specialist recommended deployment, but its analysis was based on the incorrect premise that a GPU with 45.0 GB of VRAM was available. This contradicts the findings of the Accelerator Specialist. In cases of conflicting information about hardware, the Accelerator Specialist's report takes precedence. Because the fundamental hardware requirement is not met, the optimized serving arguments suggested by the Decision Specialist were not applied.

### QA Validation
QA validation was **not run**. The deployment is a NO-GO due to the absence of required GPU hardware, making validation tests impossible to execute.

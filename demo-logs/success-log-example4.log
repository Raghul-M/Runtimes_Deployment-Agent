### Configuration Summary
The Configuration Specialist reported on four models preloaded in the model-car, with a total estimated VRAM requirement of 22 GB. The primary model for this assessment, `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`, requires an estimated 18 GB of VRAM.

### Accelerator Summary
The Accelerator Specialist confirmed that the cluster is healthy and accessible. Authentication was successful, and the cluster has NVIDIA GPUs available that are compatible with CUDA and vLLM, meeting the deployment requirements.

### Deployment Decision
The Decision Specialist has issued a **GO** for this deployment.

The specialist's reasoning is as follows:
- **GPU Capacity**: The available GPU VRAM (44.99 GB) is sufficient to meet the model's estimated requirement of 18 GB.
- **Serving-argument Suitability**: The initial serving arguments were found to be suboptimal for a single-GPU environment. The Decision Specialist recommended removing an unnecessary distributed executor flag and explicitly setting `tensor_parallel_size=1`.
- **Environment / Access Health**: The Accelerator Specialist reported no authentication or connectivity failures.

Based on the specialist's recommendation, the optimized serving arguments were written back to the model-car configuration by the Configuration Specialist. The applied optimization was:
```json
{
  "args": [
    "--uvicorn-log-level=debug",
    "--max-model-len=1024",
    "--trust-remote-code",
    "--tensor-parallel-size=1"
  ]
}
```


### QA Validation
The QA Specialist ran the Opendatahub model validation test suite against the updated configuration. The result was a **PASS**, with all 4 validation tests completing successfully. This confirms that the model serving deployments are correctly configured and operational.
